# webScrape
A simple script to scrape information from a web page and store them in a csv file 
the script scrapes graphics cards product information (brand, product_name, shipping) from newegg.com 
The script only scrapes the first page out of 2 pages
i will appreciate suggestions on how to scrapes the two pages in one script,finding it difficult at the moment
