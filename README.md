## webScrape
#A simple script to scrape information from a web page(newegg.com) and store them in a csv file 
#the script scrapes graphics cards product information (brand, product_name, shipping) from newegg.com 
#The script only scrapes the first page out of 2 pages
#i will appreciate suggestions on how to scrapes the two pages in one script,finding it difficult at the moment
# ive found a link that contains the product listings of the previous page and the second page and scraped the info once using the fllw link
